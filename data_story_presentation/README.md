## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

### **WELCOME!**

This is my final data story presentation folder! In it, you can find the final output of all the data searching, data cleaning, and data analysis. The file name for my data story: **RHU_Final_Project_Presentation.ipynb**
- The cover image for my final data story is also found in the data_story_presentation folder (titled cover.jpeg). Inspiration comes from Rose Wong with the NY Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/28/sunday-review/joy-happiness-life.html). I created my own image for this story!

My data story is a data-science article/blog. It reads like an article and integrates the data-science/coding components throughout the story. The target audience is broad, really anyone who has some sort of social or academic interest in happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being. Additionally, this includes anyone who might be interested in the connections between the current pandemic and happiness. In investigating facets of happiness, I investigate four specific subtopics: 
- **Part I**: looking at most recent complete data on how happy people were around the world in 2019.
- **Part II**: regional and longitudinal trends in happiness from the years of 2006-2019.
- **Part III**: some potential factors that may or may not be correlated with differences in happiness in different countries.
- **Part IV**: happiness in 2020 during a global pandemic and relating this back to the variables investigated in part 3. I go into quite a bit of detail for part 4, since the correlations are a little tricky and there is a lot of think about in this section.

Each part contains a visualization that summarizes key points extracted from the data analysis, presented alongside a description of what the data demonstrates and their significance. Parts 1-3 aims to provide the background to think about the complex relationships and patterns seen in Part 4. I hope that the information presented gives you something to ponder as we continue to live through this pandemic!

After all, the overall goal of my data story is to look at different aspects of happiness on a global level, to simply think about happiness. 

### **So let's look at happiness!**
